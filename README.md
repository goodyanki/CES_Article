The rise and decline of the Soviet economy
Robert C. Allen Department of Economics, University of British
Columbia
Abstract. The reasons for the rapid growth of the Soviet Union before roughly 1970 and for
its subsequent growth slowdown are analysed. The concentration of investment on heavy
industry and soft budget constraints explain most of the growth in the 1930s. The growth
slowdown was due to disastrous investment decisions following the elimination of surplus
labour and the diversion of research and development resources to the military rather than
the failure of firms to carry out plans or diminishing returns to capital.
Grandeur et décadence de l’économie soviétique. On analyse les raisons de la croissance
rapide de l’Union Soviétique avant 1970 et du ralentissement de sa croissance dans l’après.
Il semble que la concentration de l’investissement dans l’industrie lourde et des contraintes
budgétaires relativement douces expliquent le gros de la croissance dans les années 1930. Le
ralentissement de la croissance est attribuable à des décisions d’investissement désastreuses
à la suite de l’élimination du surplus de travail et du détournement des ressources de recher￾che et développement vers le secteur militaire, bien davantage qu’à l’échec des entreprises
dans la réalisation des plans ou aux rendements décroissants sur le capital.

In 1945 Harold Innis visited Moscow to attend the 220th anniversary of the Soviet
~formerly Russian! Academy of Sciences. He kept a diary of his observations in
which he warned against the ‘danger of’ Russia and the West ‘each becoming fanat￾ical and talking about the merits and demerits of the capitalist system.’ For Innis,

‘System is a fanatical term’ to be avoided. Instead, ‘universities’ must ‘take @the#
lead in adopting a neutral position’ based on ‘the search for truth.’
In this paper I take up Innis’s challenge by reconsidering the broad outlines of
Soviet economic history. The predominant interpretation today is failure – Soviet
socialism could never have worked; it was always a big mistake. Economists, on
both the left and the right, point to poor incentives and ‘principal-agent’ problems
~Kornai 1992; Roemer 1994; Bardhan and Roemer 1993!. While there were cer￾tainly many things wrong with the Soviet economy and – even more so – the Soviet
political system, a review of the evidence suggests that the condemnation of the
economy is too sweeping: in certain respects and in certain times, it performed
well; in others, it did not. The Soviet Union was one of the great experiments of the
twentieth century, and it behooves us to analyse its history carefully to see what
worked well, what worked badly, and why.
GDP per head is the first indicator that economists usually use in assessing
performance, and I begin with it. The growth record divides in two sometime around
1970. Before then, the Soviet economy was one of the most successful in the world
using per capita GDP as the measure of performance. Maddison ~1995! has esti￾mated GDP in 1991 U.S. dollars for the fifty-six leading economies back to 1820.
Figure 1 plots the proportional growth in GDP per head from 1928 to 1970 against
the level of 1928 when the first Five Year Plan started. The squares indicate the
OECD countries. It should be noted that they were the rich countries in the world in
1928, as, indeed, they had been in 1820. The exception to this generalization is
Japan, which was poor in 1820 and in 1928 and has been the most successful
economy in the world since then. Among the OECD countries, the poorer have
grown faster than the richer, as countries like Spain, Norway, and Ireland have
caught up with the leaders. The ‘convergence regression’ summarizes this trend.
Convergence, it should be emphasized, has not extended beyond the OECD; the
predominant tendency in the world economy has been income divergence ~Pritchett
1997!. In 1820 western Europe was two and a half times richer than South Asia; by
1989 the lead had grown to fifteen times. The non-OECD countries appear mainly
in the lower left hand of the graph with low initial income levels in 1928 and low
growth since. A few countries like Argentina had high incomes in 1928 and have
shown slow growth since – initial successes that fell off the rails.
Where does the USSR fit into this pattern? Its income was low in 1928, and its
growth rate was high. It was the most successful non-OECD country in this period.
Even by the OECD standard it did well, since it grew faster than the OECD con￾vergence regression – a stringent standard, since it requires particularly rapid growth
for poor countries. From 1928 to 1970 the USSR did not grow as fast as Japan, but
was arguably the second most successful economy in the world.
Many scholars of the Soviet Union would disagree in judging Soviet economic
performance a ‘success’ for three reasons: ~1! political repression and the famine
mortality following the collectivization of agriculture, ~2! negligible growth in con￾sumption, and ~3! the failure of the Soviet Union to achieve a western standard of
living. These objections, however, are not decisive. First, while the repression and
famine were certainly deplorable, the issue in an economic assessment is how they
were related to economic performance. Simulations discussed later show that the
state terrorism accompanying the collectivization of agriculture did increase growth
but by only a small amount. Conversely, the Soviet policies that were decisive for
increasing growth did not have dire consequences. Second, the view that consump￾tion per head did not rise in the 1930s was propounded by Bergson ~1961! using
data available in the 1950s. Evidence that has subsequently become available and
advances in index number theory suggest that per capita consumption increased by
one-quarter in the 1930s.2 The gains accrued to the urban population and to those
who moved to the cities. If the GDP increase were only steel and tanks, one might
dismiss the growth record as a failure, but rapid growth in consumption as well as
investment was a good performance. Third, the right comparison group for assess￾ing Soviet performance is not the United States, despite the enthusiasm of both
communists and Americans for that comparison, but rather other countries with a
similar level of income in 1928. The USSR outperformed all of those countries
except Japan. Some commentators have speculated that Tsarist Russia would have
closed the gap with the West had the 1917 revolution not occurred ~Gregory 1994!,
but the claim is speculation unsupported by modelling.
Growth began to slow down in the 1960s, and success turned to failure after
1970, when the growth rate dropped dramatically. GNP grew in excess of 5 per cent
2 Allen ~1998c! provides a detailed discussion. Hunter and Szyrmer’s ~1992! reassessment of Soviet
performance leads to the same conclusion reached in Allen ~1998c!.

per year from 1928 to 1970, but the annual rate dropped to 3.7 per cent in 1970–75,
then to 2.6 per cent in 1975–80, finally hitting 2.0 per cent in 1980–85 ~table 1!.
The rapid growth before 1970 was due to exceptional growth of the capital stock, a
big increase in employment ~especially in the 1930s!, and some expansion of the
cultivated acreage. Productivity grew at a rate similar to that of the East Asian
economies during their boom. Indeed, the sources of high-speed growth in the
USSR look much like those of South Korea or Taiwan ~Young 1995!.
The growth slowdown was the result of deterioration in all sources of growth.
Employment growth plummeted, and there was a reduction in land under cultiva￾tion. The growth of the capital stock declined, although it was still much faster than
that of the other inputs. The slowdown in accumulation was not due to a drop in the
investment rate, which continued to rise, but to the decline in GDP growth. Most
dramatically, total factor productivity growth went negative. This result is quite
controversial, as we will see, since it presumes a Cobb-Douglas production func￾tion, which is disputed.
This growth record poses the paradoxical questions of Soviet economic history:
Why was growth so rapid from 1928 to about 1970? Then, why did performance
deteriorate so abruptly? Capital accumulation will be the protagonist in the narra￾tive proposed here. In 1928 the USSR was a capital-scarce, labour-surplus econ￾omy. It grew rapidly for half a century as the investment rate was pushed steadily
higher. How that was done will be shown. By the 1970s this phase of growth was
over – everyone had a job. Growth then slowed down. Here the narrative choices
become great. There are three stories to choose from. The usual story among Sovi￾etologists attributes the growth slowdown to technological failure, which, in turn, is
attributed to poor incentives to innovate. The second story denies the fall in TFP
growth shown in table 1 and, instead, attributes the growth slowdown to diminish￾ing returns to capital. The question turns on the elasticity of substitution between
capital and labour. There is no role for policy error in this approach. The third

approach, which I will advance here, attributes the growth slowdown to horrendous
investment decisions. It is not a coincidence, in this view, that the economy slowed
down when it did. The end of surplus labour posed new challenges. The Communist
leadership flubbed them.
Why was growth rapid from 1928 to 1940?
Before considering failure, we will analyse fast growth. How did the USSR succeed
in growing so rapidly from 1928 to 1970? In 1928 the country had a small capital
stock and a large, ineffectively employed, rural population. The rapid accumulation
of capital was the key to rapid growth. The investment rate was pushed up from
8 per cent in 1928 to over 20 per cent in the mid-1930s ~Moorsteen and Powell
1966, 364!. As a result, the capital stock grew rapidly, as shown in table 1. The
central issue is explaining this rise in investment. There are three policies or insti￾tutions that need to be analysed.
The first was the allocation of producer goods. In the 1930s the Five Year Plans
increased the fraction of producer goods – machinery and construction – allocated
to the producer goods sector itself. Steel and machinery output were high priorities,
and their output expanded explosively as the ever greater volumes of steel and
machines were ploughed back into those sectors. How much of the accumulation
was due to this investment policy?
The second was the collectivization of agriculture. In the industrialization debate
of the 1920s Preobrazhensky ~1926! is famous for having advocated that heavy
industry be financed by the state’s turning the terms of trade against the peasants. In
the ‘standard story’ Stalin accomplished this by herding the peasants into collective
farms where they were forced to hand over a large fraction of agricultural output at
low prices dictated by the state ~Millar 1970.! While important features of this story
have been refuted – for example, agriculture’s terms of trade actually improved
during the first Five Year Plan, owing to the thirty-fold inflation of food prices on
the unregulated farmers’ markets ~Ellman 1975! – the question remains whether
investment could have been increased without impoverishing the rural population.
As Alec Nove ~1964! put it: Was Stalin Necessary?
The third was the use of output targets and the corresponding provision of soft
budgets to direct industrial enterprises. During the New Economic Policy, industry
was organized into trusts and directed to maximize profits. Soft budgets first appeared
in the mid-1920s, when the state tried to increased agricultural sales by lowering
the prices of manufactured goods ~Johnson and Temin 1993!. In the 1930s soft
budgets became general, as firms were given output targets and the bank credits to
finance them. Kornai ~1992! criticized these practices in the 1980s, when there was
full employment. The question is whether employment-creating policies like soft
budgets may have accelerated growth under the surplus labour conditions of the
1930s.
I have analysed these policies with a series of simulation models that describe
counterfactuals that are further and further removed from actual Soviet experience
Rise and decline of the Soviet economy 863
~Allen 1998a,b, with revisions!. Alternative investment strategies are captured by
increasing the fraction of producer goods output reinvested in that sector ~e! from
7 per cent in the 1920s to 23 per cent in the mid-1930s; analysing collectivization
requires introducing free markets for food, eliminating the 1933–34 famine and
altering rural-urban migration functions; modelling soft budgets requires that a
hard-budget alternative be created. In the soft-budget model full employment is
imposed and the marginal product of labour sinks below the wage; in the hard￾budget model the wage equals the marginal product, and unemployment results.
So far as capital accumulation is concerned, the results of the simulations are
summarized in table 2. Two factors were of cardinal importance in promoting accu￾mulation – the investment strategy emphasizing heavy industry, and the imposition
of high output targets in conjunction with the soft-budget constraint. Consider the
following thought experiment. We begin with the economy least like the Soviet
Union in the 1930s, that is, with a capitalist employment rule ~employment is set so
the wage equals the value of the marginal product of labour! and an investment
strategy that simply replicates the consumer goods oriented capital stock of the
1920s ~i.e., e 5 0.07!. That economy would generate a 1939 capital stock of 162.9
billion rubles – not much above the 1928 starting value of 136.3 and a scant increase
on a per capita basis. Now let e rise to 0.23. In that case, the 1939 capital stock
equals 258.7 – a jump of 90 per cent. The strategy of investing in heavy industry
pays off! Next replace the hard-budget constraint with the soft-budget constraint.
The simulated capital stock rises to 318.0 in 1939 – a further gain of 23 per cent.
The soft-budget constraint also pays off. Finally, imagine that the free-market rela￾tionship between agriculture and industry that characterized the NEP were replaced
by the obligatory deliveries and state-imposed prices that characterized collectiv￾ization. The simulated capital stock would again rise, but only to 343.9 – an addi￾tional gain of 8 per cent. There is little pay-off to collectivization. Since the simulated

capital stock is within 0.2 per cent of the actual 1939 value of 344.7, the thought
experiment shows that the investment strategy and the soft-budget constraint com￾prise a complete explanation of Soviet accumulation; it is not necessary to invoke
other factors to account for what happened.
Similar results obtain when GDP, non-agricultural value added, and per capita
consumption are analysed. The results for consumption are particularly interesting;
for they show that increases in the fraction of producer goods output reinvested in
that sector increased consumption per head by 1940. In the totalitarian model of
communism ~Tucker 1977!, increased military power is the motive for expanding
heavy industry, but Gosplan economists like Fel’dman promoted the policy in the
1920s on the grounds that a larger capital goods sector would provide the equip￾ment to expand the consumer goods industries ~Domar 1957!. My simulations of
the Soviet economy show that Fel’dman’s projections were realized within a decade.
The role of collectivization in Soviet development has been so controversial that
it deserves more comment. The simulations show that collectivization had a nega￾tive effect on all indicators – GDP, investment, consumption, and, of course, pop￾ulation – in the mid-1930s. However, collectivization pushed up the growth rate
enough in the rest of the decade to raise GDP, capital accumulation, and consump￾tion above the 1939 levels they would have realized had the agrarian system of the
1920s been preserved. Collectivization raised growth by increasing rural-urban migra￾tion: First, low procurement prices lowered farm incomes below the level they
would have otherwise reached. Migration increased in consequence, since it was a
function of the ratio of urban to rural income. Second, the deportation of ‘kulaks’
and state terrorism in general increased the rate of rural-urban migration at every
ratio of urban to rural consumption. Terrorism increased economic growth to that
small degree.
These findings point towards three important conclusions about institutions and
Soviet economic development. First, the New Economic Policy, which involved the
preservation of peasant farming and a market relationship between town and coun￾try, was a conducive framework for rapid industrialization. Collectivization made
little additional contribution to this effort. Stalin, in other words, was not necessary.
Second, the autarchic development of the producer goods sector was a viable source
of new capital equipment. Exporting wheat and importing machinery – that is,
following comparative advantage – was not necessary for rapid growth. Third, the
central planning of firm output in conjunction with the soft-budget constraint was
effective in mobilizing otherwise unemployed labour. This additional employment
made a significant contribution to output as well as distributing consumption widely.
While the development of socialism was conducive to economic growth in the
Soviet Union during the 1930s, the barbaric policies of Stalinism added very little
to industrial output. In particular, the collectivization of agriculture – perhaps the
archetypical Stalinist policy and the one that resulted in the most avoidable death –
made only a modest contribution to growth. Modifying the NEP to include central
planning, high employment, and the expansion of heavy industry was a program for
growth in capital, output, and per capita living standards. Adding collectivization to
that recipe contributed little to growth and corrupted socialism.
Rise and decline of the Soviet economy 865
866 R.C. Allen
Why did the growth rate drop? Technological failure
Why did the economy, which grew so rapidly from the 1920s into the 1960s, per￾form so badly in the 1970s and the 1980s? There are three approaches to this ques￾tion – technological failure, diminishing returns to capital, and errors in investment.
They are prompted by different readings of the figures in table 1.
Technological failure is probably the most common explanation among Soviet￾ologists ~e.g., Bergson 1978!. The drop in TFP shown in table 1 is variously attrib￾uted to the impossibility of planning a large economy, the baleful effects of soft
budgets, enterprise managers’ stockpiling inputs to ensure meeting targets, and
inadequate incentives to promote technical progress. In these accounts, the Soviet
decline shows the impossibility of socialism.
There are many difficulties with this line of explanation. One possibility, which
emerges from some of the other explanations, is that the TFP series shown in table 1
is erroneous because the Soviet production function was not a Cobb-Douglas func￾tion as presumed in conventional growth accounting. Accepting for the moment the
reality of the productivity drop, there are three reasons for doubting that it reflects
a failure of Soviet R&D institutions.
First, there is a timing problem. The Soviet research and development institu￾tions and the incentives to which they gave rise were long standing. They did not
change around 1970. Easterly and Fischer ~1995! note that if they did not change, it
is hard to see how they can explain the abrupt drop in productivity.
Second, the disincentives to innovate may not have been as strong as is usually
believed. The standard critique was developed by Joe Berliner ~1976a! ‘The general
problem with the old economic structure @central planning# is that it gave maximal
encouragement to decision makers to favor established products and processes, and
to discriminate against innovations “as the devil shies away from incense,” in Mr
Brezhnev’s words.’ Berliner ~1976b, 437, 444! offers many reasons for this conser￾vatism, including the following: first, research and development was carried out by
institutes rather than by the businesses that would use the new products or pro￾cesses. These institutes either chose their own projects or were assigned projects by
higher level authorities. In either case, projects were not suggested by the produc￾tion or sales departments of businesses and so research was not directed to meeting
the needs of business and the new techniques produced by the labs were often of
little practical use or were too imperfectly developed to be of immediate value.
Second, the pricing of new models tended to pass on the gains of improved perfor￾mance to consumers rather than benefiting the innovating enterprises. Third, man￾agers were rewarded for meeting output targets, so they had little incentive to innovate.
‘The reason is that the changeover to a new product or a new manufacturing process
always results in a slowdown in the current rate of output’ and that slowdown threat￾ens the manager’s bonus for meeting his output target. Consequently, the lack of
information flow between producers and designers could not be solved by creating
manufacturing departments in firms, since the firm managers found it financially
rewarding to transfer the R&D personnel and equipment to current production if
that was necessary to meet output targets. For instance, Glavneftemash, which made
two-thirds of the USSR’s oil field equipment, assigned its research facilities to
current production in order to meet the heavy demand for drilling rigs during Brezh￾nev’s oil and gas offensives ~Gustafson 1989, 190!.
These considerations do not provide a complete account of Soviet technological
performance because there was progressive behaviour as well. Higher productivity
required intelligent decisions by planners and spontaneous attempts by enterprises
to improve performance, and both occurred. The cement industry, admittedly not
the most glamorous, is a case in point ~Abouchar 1976!. Productivity increased,
better processes were introduced, and the geographical balance between production
and consumption was improved. Perhaps most important, the character of invention
and innovation was very different from that predicted by Berliner. ‘The journals in
this period contain abundant evidence of experimentation – on the plant sites and
not just in central laboratories.’ The result was further ‘improvements: more effi-
cient heat transfer apparatus and chimney design modifications to reduce stack loss,
two-end kiln feeding, and so on.’ Despite Berliner’s ~1976b, 444! conclusion that
‘there was very little incentive for self-initiated innovative activity at the enterprise
level,’ much experimentation went on.
Third, there was an external development that coincided with the drop in Soviet
productivity and that may explain it. That development was the arms race with the
Americans during the Brezhnev period. The magnitude of Soviet military spending
and its impact on the economy were heatedly debated in American defence circles
during the 1980s ~Adams 1992; Firth and Noren 1998; Jacobsen 1987; Noren 1995;
Rosefielde 1982; Rowen and Wolf 1990!. After much revision, the CIA concluded
that the USSR spent 12 per cent of its GDP on defence in 1966–70 against 16 per
cent in 1981–85 ~Davis 1992, 193!. This increase was probably not large enough to
significantly affect the growth rate, since even one-for-one ruble substitution of
investment for defence spending would have raised the investment rate by only
one-ninth ~from 36 to 40 per cent of GDP!.
The increase in defence spending may have lowered productivity growth, how￾ever, by diverting R&D resources from civilian to military innovation. It is difficult
to measure the rate of invention, but the available indicators suggest that it was
declining in the USSR, at least for the civilian economy. The Soviets did publish
considerable statistics on the number of new prototypes brought into use. While
such numbers are always hard to interpret, Kontorovich ~1987, 1990! has argued
that they indicate the volume of newly available technologies, and Amann ~1986!
has pressed them into service. They show a decline in the absolute number of new
inventions brought into use each year from the 1960s to 1985. Kontorovich ~1990,
267! has divided them into civilian and military innovations and argued that the fall
was largely confined to the civilian sector.
These shifts in the output of the R&D sector reflected a reallocation of inputs to
the military. According to Campbell ~1990, 141–2!, the defence ‘ministries were
absorbing the lion’s share of the resource increment in R&D’ – in particular, tech￾nical employees – ‘in the decade preceding 1985, starving the civilian R&D func￾tion.’ Moreover, the defence ‘ministries were winning out over the civilian ministries
in the struggle for investment resources,’ so producing an investment crisis in non￾Rise and decline of the Soviet economy 867

defence machinery production. Kontorovich ~1990, 267! attributed much of the
decline to the arms race: ‘resources were shifted from civilian to military R&D in
1965–85.’ Campbell ~1990, 127! agreed: ‘resource allocation to the military sector
became increasingly burdensome’ from 1976 to 1985. ‘It was an important contrib￾utor to the slowdown in economic growth, primarily through its deleterious impact
on the civilian machinery industry and on investment.’
The same conclusion is supported by industry studies that show the lack of
investment in civilian machinery and trace it back to resource conflicts between the
military and civilian economies. The oil and gas industry is a prime example; for it
was the priority civilian activity in the 1970s and 1980s. Soviet efforts to increase
production were hampered by inadequate industrial support. Throughout the period,
oil field equipment continued to be made in the antiquated plants of Glavneftemash.
Investment was not available for reconstruction, let alone expansion. The Soviet gas
campaign required six new pipelines, and they, in turn, required 21,000 km of
1420 mm diameter pipe. Virtually all of this pipe was imported, since it would have
taken too long to build the mills for the Soviet steel industry to make it. ‘In metals
as in machinery, the underlying reasons for failure have been abysmal civilian inno￾vation and competition for the best people and the best output from the military￾industrial sector ~the former obviously aggravated by the latter!.’The pipelines also
required hundreds of compressors to push the gas from Siberia to Europe. Nevskii
Zavod produced a satisfactory 10 MW compressor by the mid-1970s, but never
managed to produce a reliable 25 MW model. The most successful large Soviet
compressor was one based on a converted jet engine supplied by the Ministry of the
Aviation Industry and produced at the Frunze plant. ‘The chronic problems at Nevskii
Zavod ~and the lesser but substantial difficulties at the Frunze plant in Sumy! had
little to do with high technology; rather, the case illustrates the debilitating effects
of competition from military priorities on civilian programs, even high-priority
ones.’ Productivity growth in investment as well as in consumer goods industries
was stifled by the allocation of resources to the military: ‘A major reason for the
technological stagnation of the civilian machinery sector was the preferential chan￾nelling of resources to the ministries making military machinery.’~Gustafson 1989,
190, 193, 204–8, 212.!
If the Cold War was responsible for the drop in Soviet productivity growth, then
it accounts for over half of the Soviet growth slowdown. TFP growth dropped from
1.5 per cent per year to 2 0.5 per cent between the 1960s and 1980–85. Reversing
the productivity slowdown by adding 2 per cent to the 1980–85 GNP growth rate
increases the latter from 2 to 4 per cent per year. This is still less than the 5.7 per
cent growth of the 1960s, but certainly is a much better performance.
Why did the growth rate drop? Diminishing returns to capital
The Cold War may have been one factor contributing to the fall in Soviet produc￾tivity, but there are other approaches to the problem, and they indicate that other
factors were at work. Growth deceleration was already apparent in annual data for
the 1950s and 1960s, and it was already being attributed to technological failures
manifest as declining TFP growth. Productivity in these arguments was calculated
with a standard Cobb-Douglas framework with constant factor shares like those in
the West. Weitzman ~1970! challenged this interpretation by estimating a produc￾tion function for the USSR. He concluded that the Cobb-Douglas specification was
incorrect, and that the Soviet experience was better represented by a CES function
with an elasticity of substitution between capital and labour of .4. In this frame￾work, the growth deceleration is due to diminishing returns to capital; there is not
evidence of a fall in TFP growth. The growth slowdown, in other words, does not
indicate poor institutional performance. Easterley and Fisher have redone the econo￾metrics with more recent data and confirmed the elasticity of substitution. They
have been reluctant, however, to exonerate Soviet institutions.
One of the attractive features of the Weitzman-Easterly-Fischer approach is that
it can be extended to provide an integrated account of both the success and failure
of the Soviet economy. Figure 2 shows a diagram that allows us to tell the story of
Soviet history in a simplified form. The depiction is starker than Weitzman’s because
the isoquants assume fixed proportions – an elasticity of substitution of zero rather
than 0.4 – but the logic is more clearly revealed. In this framework, a rise in the
investment rate caused rapid growth in the 1930s and 1940s as surplus labour was
put to work. By the 1950s structural unemployment was eliminated and growth
slowed down as capital accumulation ran into diminishing returns.
The diagram presupposes that fixed quantities of capital and labour are required
to produce a unit of GPD, as indicated by point Y1. These proportions are preserved
along the diagonal OY2. More labour ~L2! or capital ~K2! yields no extra output so
FIGURE 2 Weitzman growth model

long as the quantity of the other is fixed. Constant returns to scale is assumed, so
that doubling the capital ~from K1 to K2! and labour ~from L1 to L2! doubles output
~from Y1 to Y2!.
In 1928 the Soviet Union was at a point like A. Output was limited to one unit
~Y1! by the available capital ~K1! and L2 2 L1 units of labour were in surplus. In this
case, accumulating capital increased output by moving the economy upwards along
a vertical line from A to Y2; indeed, in this period output and capital grew at the
same rate. Surplus labour was correspondingly reduced. This shift corresponds to
the period 1928–70, when the USSR grew rapidly by accumulating capital.
The era of high-speed growth ended, however, when the economy reached Y2,
and surplus labour was exhausted. Thereafter, capital accumulation failed to gen￾erate growth. As the economy accumulated capital, it moved upwards along the
vertical part of the isoquant where capital was in surplus and labour constrained
production. In that case, output failed to grow. Indeed, there was a quick transition
from fast growth to stagnation. In real time, the transition occurred in the late 1960s
and early 1970s. One indicator of the change is unfilled vacancies on the first shift,
which rose from 1 per cent in 1960, to 4.9 per cent in 1970, to 7.3 per cent in 1975,
then to 9.9 per cent in 1980, and finally hit 12.2 per cent in 1985 ~Rumer 1989,
199–200!. In the 1970s a Gosplan research director reported that 10–12 per cent of
the increment in real fixed capital was unutilized, owing to a shortage of labour
~Rumer 1989, 202!, and that proportion could only have increased in the 1980s. The
capital stock rose without a corresponding rise in GDP because there was no labour
to operate the new capacity.
Weitzman’s statistical results support this story in a nuanced fashion. With an
elasticity of substitution of 0.4, the isoquant has a curved corner rather than a right
angle. As a result, the growth slowdown takes place over a decade or two rather than
occurring instantaneously. History is more accurately replicated, but the underlying
logic is the same as that shown in figure 2.
To see how Weitzman’s statistical results imply rapid growth then an abrupt
slowdown, we can embed his production function in a Solow ~1956! 0 Swan ~1956!
growth model: GDP is a function of the capital stock and labour force, an exog￾enously given fraction of output is invested, and capital grows as the stock in one
year is increased by investment and reduced by depreciation. Production is com￾puted from a CES ~constant elasticity of substitution! production function:

where Yt is GDP in year t, Kt is the capital stock, and Lt is the labour, which is
assumed equal to the population and to grow at its historical rate. The parameter
values are those estimated by Weitzman: h 5 0.639, and p 5 1.481389, implied by
an elasticity of substitution of 0.403. The constant A is chosen to make Y equal its
historical value in 1928.

The data for this exercise are derived from Maddison ~1995!.
3 The Second World
War is dealt with in a highly stylized way, namely, by leaving it out: GDP was
similar in 1940 and in 1948, so the intervening years were omitted, and the capital
stock in 1940 was carried over to 1948. The population in the 1930s was inter￾polated between 1928 and 1948.
Figure 3 contrasts the actual history of real GDP per head in the Soviet Union
between 1928 and 1989 with the series implied by equations ~1!–~3!. The corre￾spondence is remarkably close: The series are within 10 per cent of each other in
1989, despite the simplicity of the model and the cavalier treatment of the Second
3 Maddison’s estimate of GDP in 1991 US dollars is the measure of output. The labour force is mea￾sured by the population since that indexes the potential labour supply, which is the relevant mea￾sure in assessing the impact of surplus labour and its elimination. The capital stock is calculated
with equations 2 and 3 from Maddison’s GDP series, the historical series of investment rates, and a
value of 2 for the capital-output ratio in 1928. This value is slightly higher than the value of 1.68
calculated by ~Moorsteen and Powell 1966, 367!. For 1960–89 the investment rate was taken from
the Penn World Tables. Investment rates for earlier years were extrapolated from the 1960 value
using Moorsteen and Powell’s ~1966, 364! series. The depreciation rate in equation ~3! was taken to
be 3 per cent, which is consistent with Moorsteen and Powell’s work. Applying these assumptions
to equations ~2! and ~3! implies the Soviet capital stock in 1991 U.S. dollars.

FIGURE 4 Soviet unit isoquant, 1928–89
World War. The simulation mimics the remarkably fast growth of the Stalinist period,
and the growth slowdown of the final decades of Soviet power. The import of the
simulation is that these facts can be entirely explained by the logic of capital accu￾mulation under the assumption of a low elasticity of substitution between capital
and labour.
Figure 4 shows why the model captures the main lines of Soviet history. The
former shows the unit isoquant implied by the Weitzman-style production function.
The sharp corner is apparent. In 1928 the Soviet Union was at the right end of the
isoquant with little capital and lots of labour, and it moved to the left as accumula￾tion proceeded. The dates at which the economy reached various points are shown
in the figure, and it passed the corner in the 1960s as growth began to decelerate.
Diminishing returns to capital: can we believe it?
Weitzman’s explanation is very elegant. It complements the account of rapid devel￾opment given earlier by advancing one mechanism by which the elimination of
surplus labour would cut the rate of growth. But is a low elasticity of substitution
really the explanation for the Soviet climacteric?
Weitzman’s theory is hard to credit when seen in international perspective. Japan
is an important contrast. It may have been even more devastated than the Soviet
Union in 1945, and its recovery in the late 1940s was slower. In 1950 GDP per head
was $2834 in the USSR and $1873 in Japan. By that time the Soviets had already
raised their investment rate to 22 per cent – higher than levels in the 1930s – and the
Japanese rate was 17 per cent. Both countries grew by pushing their investment
rates even higher, reaching 35 per cent and 38 per cent, respectively, in 1989.
With similar investment histories, one would expect similar growth performance
if the Weitzman model were the full story. But the growth histories were very
different. While output per head flagged in the USSR, it surged upwards in Japan
and reached a western European level in 1989 ~$17,757 in Japan versus $7078 in
the USSR!. While the capital stock per head was also lower in Japan in 1950, that
figure, too, quickly surpassed the Soviet level, reaching a value almost twice that of
the USSR in 1989.4 If the Weitzman story had applied in Japan, then growth should
have been choked off as the capital-labour ratio rose. Why was Japan so different?
One difference was in the elasticity of substitution. Weitzman’s econometrics
imply a value of 0.403 – a figure confirmed by Easterly and Fischer ~1995, 357! for
the whole economy. But 0.4 is an unusually low value. Evidence for Japan and other
advanced capitalist economies suggests a value of 1.0 or even greater ~Easterly and
Fischer 1995, 359–61; Duffy and Papageorgiou 2000!. While simulations using an
elasticity of substitution of 0.403 imply a growth slowdown, simulations with a
value of 1.0 do not: With more substitutability between capital and labour, dimin￾ishing returns to capital are not substantial enough to cause stagnation, and this is
why a high investment rate paid off in Japan but not in the USSR. Why was the
elasticity of substitution so low in the Soviet Union? Why was it only the USSR that
failed to translate high investment in the 1970s and 1980s into greater output?5
Investment policy and productivity slowdown
Weitzman and Easterly and Fischer speculate on reasons why the elasticity of sub￾stitution might have been lower in the USSR than elsewhere, without coming to
firm conclusions. This is good; for, I will argue, the value of 0.4 is an illusion. The
low measured value of the elasticity reflects massive errors in Soviet investment
strategy rather than a real difference in technology. It was not purely happenstance
that these errors occurred in the 1970s and 1980s; for the end of the surplus labour
economy posed new management problems, and the party leadership bungled them.
During the 1960s there were two changes in investment policy that were highly
deleterious. First, investment shifted from the construction of new manufacturing
facilities to the modernization of old ones. Second, the depletion of old oil fields
and mining districts led to a redirection of investment from Europe to Siberia. Both
changes involved huge expenditures and these cumulated into a rapid growth in the
4 The capital stock was cumulated from Maddison’s output series and Japanese investment rates
using the same procedures and depreciation rate as were used for the Soviet series.
5 An alternative approach to the data is to question their reliability. Wolf ~1992, 135!, for instance,
claims that ‘much of the growth reported in capital investment in the 1970s and early 1980s did not
occur.’ The reason is that inflation in investment goods was underestimated by the Soviets, so that
their reported series of real investment overstates real growth. However, Rumer ~1990, 274! esti￾mated this omitted inflation. Deflating Soviet investment by Rumer’s rate of price increase does not
change the results in a historically meaningful way.
Rise and decline of the Soviet economy 873
capital stock, as shown in table 1. However, the massive accumulation did not lead
to more output, since the investment was largely wasted.
Under this circumstance, standard econometric techniques give misleading results
when applied to Soviet data. Fitting production functions to the inputs and outputs
of capitalist firms is justified by the assumption that they minimize costs, so that the
observed data are efficient input choices and lie on the firms’ isoquants. The assump￾tion of cost minimization did not obtain for the Soviet Union, however. When out￾put per unit of capital and labour in the USSR are plotted as in figure 4, the result is
a sharp vertical movement in what appears to be an isoquant. In terms of the post-
1970 aggregate data shown in table 1, there is the rapid growth of the capital stock
in conjunction with small growth in employment and GDP. Fitting a production
function to the data indicates a low elasticity of substitution. However, this result
should be regarded as spurious. Whatever the ‘true’ isoquant, the data do not reveal
it; instead, they are accounted for by a massive misallocation of investment.
We can get at the role of investment policy by examining input and output growth
at the industry level, where there was considerable variation in behaviour. Table 3
shows total factor productivity growth for major industries. The average TFP growth
of these industries shows roughly the same decline as the aggregate Soviet data in
table 1, but the average encompasses some satisfactory performances and some
disasters. Generally, the industries with good productivity records had capital￾output ratios that were fairly stable. In electricity generation, for instance, output

increased by a factor of 2.3 from 1965 to 1975, while the capital stock grew 2.1
times. From 1975 to 1985, output increased 1.5 times, while the capital stock grew
by 1.7 times. In contrast, industries with poor productivity records showed large
increases in the capital stock without reductions in employment or increases in
output. In ferrous metals, for instance, the capital stock went up by 55 per cent
between 1975 and 1985, while employment rose 9 per cent, and output grew by
only 10 per cent. As a result, total factor productivity dropped 12 per cent. How
could so much capital be poured into the iron and steel industry with such a scant
increase in output and no saving of labour?
Two factors explain the difference between steel and electricity. One was the
degree of reconstruction investment undertaken: the industries with high levels of
reconstruction investment exhibited big increases in capital with little increase in
output and, consequently, falling productivity. In 1970, for instance, 20 per cent of
the investment in electricity generation went to ‘technical reequipping, reconstruc￾tion, and expansion of existing production,’ while the proportion in ferrous metals
was 60 per cent. The fractions jumped to 34 per cent and 80 per cent in the next
decade. The second factor was the seriousness of mineral depletion and the invest￾ments in Siberian resources that were taken to offset it. The former cut productivity
in existing operations, and the latter led to vast investments that maintained output
with more expensive inputs. These were not issues in electrical generation, but they
plagued the steel industry.
Japan showed the world how to boost productivity in steel making. Between
1960 and 1985, Japanese steel production grew from 26.9 to 105.3 million tons, and
Japan was renowned as the most efficient producer in the world ~see U.S. Statistical
Abstract, 1962, 925; 1988, 814!. Japan’s success was achieved by building nine new
integrated steel mills on large coastal sites with an average capacity of 9 million
tons ~Hasegawa 1996, 81!. The minimum efficient size of a steel mill was 6 million
tons per year in this period ~ibid., 162!, and the new Japanese steel mills exceeded
that size.
Soviet productivity went up so long as the Soviets acted like the Japanese; other￾wise, it declined. From 1960 to 1985 Soviet steel production increased by 90 mil￾lion tons ~from 65.3 million to 155 million.! About 55.8 million tons of the steel
smelted in the USSR in 1980 were made in eight ‘green field’ plants built in the
1960s and 1970s. Those plants accounted for five-eighths of the increase in output
from 1960 to 1980. They were large enough to realize scale economies, but – despite
frequent complaints about excessive ‘giantism’ in Soviet industry – they were some￾what smaller than new Japanese steel plants: 7 million tons in the USSR versus 9
million tons in Japan ~Rumer 1989, 51–75!. These plants pushed up TFP and account
for the rise in efficiency in 1965–75 shown in table 3.
Older plants made 58 per cent of general purpose Soviet steel6 and accounted
for the remaining three-eighths of the increase in production after 1960. This group
included the famous mills, such as Magnitogorsk and Kuznetsk, constructed in the

See Rumer ~1989, 54!.

1930s as well as mills in the Ukraine dating back to the nineteenth century. Although
Magnitogorsk had a capacity of 16 million tons, its plant site was highly congested,
its equipment was obsolete, and its high-grade ore deposits were exhausted. The
rest of the older plants had capacities of 1–5 million tons. Not only were they too
small to realize scale economies, but their sites were overcrowded. The post-1960
mills had about 140 hectares per million tons of capacity, while interwar mills had
only 90 hectares ~Rumer 1989, 56!. The smaller mills were often unintegrated.
Gosplan studies showed that it cost 55 per cent more to increase capacity in old
works than in green-field sites ~Rumer 1990, 15; 1989, 211!. Furthermore, these
investments failed to shake out labour, since there was no agreement on employ￾ment norms in re-engineered plants. Plants in the Russian Republic that received
reconstruction investment in the early 1970s actually increased their workforces by
18 per cent ~Rumer 1989, 202!.
In the 1960s and 1970s the Soviets spent their investment budgets wisely in the
steel industry. Green-field sites were developed, and they greatly increased output.
The shift in emphasis to reconstruction of old sites was disastrous. It resulted in
little increase in output or reduction in the use of labour or raw materials. The
planners were not able to monitor changes in capacity, nor did they have objective
norms to assess employment levels. As a result, the shift to reconstruction invest￾ment allowed firm managers to accumulate labour and capital to meet future output
targets. A great deal of money was spent for little gain.
Resource depletion
Reconstruction investment was a great waste of funds, but it was not the only fruitless
investment.Three industries hadTFP falls of more than 10 per cent between 1975 and
1985: coal, oil, and ferrous metals.These were natural resource industries plagued by
depletion and burdened by the heavy expense of expanding production in Siberia. In￾deed, the development of Siberian natural resources was a vast sink for investment
rubles. The Soviet Union is often seen as ‘blessed’ with abundant natural resources.
Before the 1970s this was true in that many of the resources that were being exploited
were in European Russia or just east of the Urals, and their exploitation was compar￾atively cheap. By the 1970s, however, the locus of resource exploitation had shifted
to Siberia, where costs were very much higher. By then, the Soviet Union’s ‘abun￾dant’ natural resources had become a curse. Resource development swallowed up a
large fraction of the investment budget for little increase in GDP.
The problems were acute in iron mining, which accounted for 30 per cent of
ferrous metal investment ~Rumer 1989, 205!. Between 1960 and 1980 the produc￾tion of iron ore increased from 142.1 million tons to 502.0 million, making the
USSR the world’s largest producer. Fifteen open-pit mines accounted for 80 per
cent of the growth in production. These were, of course, giant cones that became
narrower as they were pushed deeper into the earth. Each year they were driven
down another 5–12 m. Between 1976 and 1980 the share of ore from mines of less
than 200 m declined from 74 to 58 per cent ~ibid., 151!. The iron content dropped
from 44.5 to 34.7 per cent, and the overburden to be removed increased. Between
1977 and 1982, alone, the total rock removed to extract one ton of commercial ore
increased from 5 to 8 tons ~ibid., 152!. As the mines became deeper, the routes to
the surface became longer and required more equipment. Likewise, the bottom
became correspondingly narrower, causing congestion and reduced productivity on
the floor of the mine. Costs rose in step with total production. New mines could be
opened, but they offered little relief, since the deposits were even more remote.
The problems were even more costly in the energy sector. Coal had traditionally
been the most important fuel. The Donbass in the Ukraine was the centre of coal
mining until the 1960s. Its production peaked in 1976, and exploitation shifted to
the lignite deposits of the Kansk-Achinsk Basin in Krasnoiarsk Province. This move
proved hugely expensive and slashed productivity ~Gustafson 1989, 27, 33!. Between
1975 and 1985 investment raised the capital stock by 62 per cent, but employment
increased by a quarter, and output grew by only 4 per cent. As a result, TFP dropped
by 24 per cent!
Oil was an even bigger sponge for capital. Before 1975 the situation appeared
trouble free, but industry failed to meets its exploration targets and then its produc￾tion targets, as exploitation was pushed further and further into Siberia. Brezhnev
responded with a series of crash programs that brought larger and larger commit￾ments of investment to the oil industry. Between 1975 and 1985 energy as a whole
increased its share of the industrial investment budget from 28 to 39 per cent. This
rise understates the capital absorbed by energy, since it excludes pipeline invest￾ment, which was tallied as transportation. Before 1975 the aggregate statistics of
the oil industry were not troublesome, but thereafter they became a nightmare. In
1975–85 the capital stock was increased by a factor of 2.42, employment rose by a
quarter, while output fell by 21 per cent. Productivity plummeted. The oil industry
sucked in capital at a great rate without yielding up more energy.
The resource constraints in metals and fuels meant that the Soviet Union was
caught in a Ricardian trap. The depletion of existing raw material sources implied
steeply rising costs – including capital costs in particular – if output was increased
from either new regions or already exploited ones. There were two solutions to this
dilemma: Replace expensive domestic raw materials with cheap imports or reduce
demand for energy and metals.
Soviet trade policy was very different from that of the advanced capitalist coun￾tries when it came to raw materials. Japan was at the opposite pole. It had few
minerals, no oil, and only a little coal, so it necessarily relied on imports for these
key raw materials. However great an obstacle this may have been to Japan’s early
development ~Yasuba 1996!, it was a great boon as transport costs fell after the
Second World War, since it meant that Japan could shop around the world for the
cheapest minerals and fuel. Economic development efforts in the Third World guar￾anteed abundant supplies at low prices. Even First World governments around the
Pacific Rim rushed to supply Japan with subsidized coal. Not having billions of
hectares of tundra to develop made the Japanese economy competitive.
Instead, the Soviets tried to be self-sufficient in everything. To a remarkable
extent they succeeded. The output of almost every mineral grew, and the USSR was
Rise and decline of the Soviet economy 877
878 R.C. Allen
usually one of the biggest producers in the world. Many of these mines would not
have been profitable if they had been evaluated at world prices. But that was not the
point in the USSR. There, the objectives were self-sufficiency and the full develop￾ment of the country’s natural resources – not creating a surplus of revenue over
cost. Early in the development process, when deposits were accessible, this strategy
did not involve great waste, but as the sources of supply became more remote, the
costs skyrocketed, and vast quantities of investment were committed to projects
that brought little gain. These show up as falling productivity in coal, oil, ferrous
metals, and ‘other products,’ which include non-ferrous metals.
The other approach to rising resource costs would have been to cut consumption.
In 1980 the USSR consumed 0.95 tons of oil equivalent per US$1000 of GDP, in
contrast to the OECD average of 0.50 tons. Canada, which has a similar climate,
consumed 0.74 tons. In the next eight years, conservation measures in the West
reduced energy consumption ~to 0.41 in the OECD as a whole and to 0.64 in Can￾ada!, while consumption in the USSR rose to 0.99 tons per US$1000 ~see A Study
of the Soviet Economy, vol. 33, IMF, World Bank, OECD, and European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, 198!.
The rise of Soviet energy consumption did not reflect a lack of concern in plan￾ning circles. Since the 1970s conservation had been part of the official rhetoric.
Indeed, some improvement had been made: electrification of the railways, more
cogeneration, more efficient power plants, and a shift from coal to oil and then to
gas ~Gustafson 1989, 230–1!.
Most Soviet energy is consumed by large industrial customers, which should
have made conservation simple, but several obstacles stood in the way. First, there
was no agreement as to appropriate norms for energy use. Second, attempts to
control energy use by raising its price were hampered by the soft-budget constraints
of many customers. Third, and most important, the majority of farms, residences,
and factories lacked meters to monitor energy consumption. The problem worsened
as gas displaced oil, since gas meters, in particular, were lacking. An energy con￾servation program of any sort required either the creation of an industry to make
meters or their importation on a massive scale ~Gustafson 1989, 236–42!. The
politicians running the economy, however, looked for immediate solutions to the
problems they faced, and establishing an industry to make meters, like erecting
steel mills to make 1420 mm pipe, would have taken too long to command interest.
Conclusion
The Soviet Union grew rapidly from 1928 to about 1970 because it rapidly accu￾mulated capital and created industrial jobs for people otherwise inefficiently employed
in agriculture. The strategy of building up heavy industry and the use of output
targets and soft budgets were effective in doing this. The growth rate dropped abruptly
after 1970 for external and internal reasons. The external reason was the Cold War,
which diverted substantial R&D resources from civilian innovation to the military
and cut the rate of productivity growth. The internal reason was the end of the
surplus labour economy: unemployment in agriculture had been eliminated and the
accessible natural resources of the country had been fully exploited. A new strategy
was needed. The Soviet leaders responded to these changes by squandering vast
sums on retooling old factories and by throwing additional fortunes into Siberian
development. It was as if the United States had decided to maintain the steel and
auto industries of the midwest by retooling the old plants and supplying them with
ore and fuel from northern Canada instead of shutting down the Rust Belt and
importing cars and steel from brand-new, state-of-the-art plants in Japan supplied
with cheap raw materials from the Third World. What the country needed was a
policy to close down old factories and shift their employees to new, high-productivity
jobs, reductions in the use of energy and industrial materials, and increased involve￾ment in world trade.
The interpretation of the Soviet decline offered here is the reverse of the analyses
that emphasize incentive problems and the resulting failure of managers to act in
accordance with the plans. On the contrary, the plans were implemented; the prob￾lem was that they did not make sense. The strength of Soviet socialism was that
great changes could be wrought by directives from the top. The expansion of heavy
industry and the use of output targets and soft budgets to direct firms were appro￾priate to the conditions of the 1930s, they were adopted quickly, and they led to
rapid growth of investment and consumption. By the 1970s the ratio of good deci￾sions to bad was falling. President Gorbachev was as bold and imaginative as any
Soviet leader was likely to be, but his economic reforms were not aimed in the right
direction. Perhaps the greatest virtue of the market system is that no single individ￾ual is in charge of the economy, so no one has to contrive solutions to the challenges
that continually arise. The early strength of the Soviet system became its great
weakness, since the economy stopped growing because of the failure of imagina￾tion at the top.
